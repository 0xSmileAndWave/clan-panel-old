IS not so that you can download and compile. It is for you to learn how these scripts work and implement your own scripts.

# Important file(s)

1.	clan-panel-old/ninja_association.swf_as/ninjasaga/linkage/ninja_association.as

# A few changes...

1.	https://cdn.static.ninjasaga.com/swf/ Change to the latest, check it from fiddler/charles
2.	On the function getBattleDefender the hashing of loc1 must be done as : loc1 + size of swf(in this case clan panel swf in bytes)
Example: Central.main.getHash(loc1+"90928");
